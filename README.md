## PART 3: Explore and Understand Data


### 2.1: Outside Humidity and Temperature Data

#### A. Visual Inspection

Goal: Visualize the data to understand what type of model we should use. 

* Q: Does the plot make sense?

* Q: Is the data seasonal?

* Q: Does the data have a trend?

* Q: Is the Data Additive or Multiplicative

* Q: Is the data Stationary

* Q: Does the data contain outliers that can potentially hinder algo performance

* Q: Is there missing data, can missing data be explained?

#### B. Decompose Time Series:

#### C. Overlaying Official Weather Data

 


### 2.2: Inside Humidity and Temperature Data



## PART 3: Data Preparation 

How prepare data for time series analysis

* Smoothing Data 


## PART 4: Builld Model to Make Predictions


### What Predict?


* Predict Temperature and Humidity:  a single step in future - by using past observations of single variable (univariate) or past observations of 
 
 * Predict Season:  given more than one time series variables (multivariate) 


### Predicting Temperature and Humidity 

Univariate Regression : Single variable input (temperature or humidity) and forecast a  numerical quantity (temperature)


Algorithms Classical Statistics:

* Triple Exponential Smoothing
* SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA

Machine Learning:
* MLP
* BNN



### Predicting Season 

* Multivariate : Multiples variables used as input 
* Classification : predict label (season)


Machine Learning Algorithm

* LSTM
* RNN
