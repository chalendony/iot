How to Make Predictions with Your Humidity and Temperature Data 

What's Ahead

1) Explore and visualize time series data collected from my Raspberry Pi HT11 Sensor 

2) Clean Prepare data for two types of predictive tasks: Regression and Classification 

3) Use classic Statistics and Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions with the time series data


Inputs: Historical data provided to the model in order to make a single forecast
Outputs: Prediction of forecast for a future time step beyond that data provided as input

What makes times series data special:

 temporal dependency, seasonality 

What Predict:
1) Temperature
2) Humidity
3) Season 


Predicting Temperature and Humidity

Univariate Regression : forecast is numerical quantity; single variable influenced by other variables


Classical Statistics:
ETS
ARIMA

Machine Learning:
MLP


Predicting Season 

Multivariate Model

Machine Learning : Temporal 


Neural Network 
Handle Temporal Dependency
LSTM
RNN


It is good practice to identify and  remove seasonality
